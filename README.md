# Hamiltonian Dynamical Systems and Sitnikov Problem

**About:** This repository has de Poincaré maps of the Sitnikov Problem in Celestial Mechanics.

## The Sitnikov Problem

The system consists of two equal-mass primary stars moving in Keplerian ellipses in the xy plane, while a test
body of negligible mass moves along the z axis. The origin of coordinates has been taken as the centre of mass of the primaries, and the motion of the planetoid remains oscillating in the z axis.

## Rungekuta Method

The problem of getting the poincare maps of this particula three-body problem was solved using the Runge-Kutta Fehtberg, which is an embedded method from the Runge–Kutta family, meaning that identical function evaluations are used in conjunction with each other to create methods of varying order and similar error constants.
